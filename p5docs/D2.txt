Five score years ago a great American in whose symbolic shadow we stand today signed the emancipation proclamation
This momentous decree is a great beacon light of hope to millions of negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice
It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity
But 100 years later the Negro still is not free
One hundred years later the life of the Negro is still badly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination
